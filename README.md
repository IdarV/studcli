##### Studcli was created because I was tired of manually navigating to Studweb to see if I had gotten my grades yet.
Hench why studcli was born, now you can easily call a python-command, and all your grades will be printed out and formatted in a nice way!

## How to use
1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install splinter via pip
3. Install phantomjs ```sudo apt-get install phantomjs```
4. Download the script.
5. Edit config.ini with your info and prefered settings
6. Run main.py using the python-command (python2)
7. (optionally) add ```alias studweb="python /path/to/studcli/main.py"``` in your zshconfig, so that you can run ```studweb``` from terminal

## Disclaimer
I made this for my own sake, and it may or may not work on your studweb.
